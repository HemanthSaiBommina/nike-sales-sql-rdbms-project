# nike-sales-sql-rdbms-project
An end-to-end SQL-based RDBMS project simulating Nike's sales operations. Built from scratch with custom tables, key constraints, realistic dummy data, and advanced SQL techniques including joins, subqueries, and CTEs. Includes a business-oriented presentation summarizing key insights and process.

This project simulates a full-scale **Nike sales ecosystem** built from scratch using **pure SQL**. It demonstrates data modeling, relational schema creation, and advanced querying to extract business insights using a self-designed RDBMS.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- ✅ Designed a full relational schema with normalized tables.
- ✅ Populated tables with randomized sales data.
- ✅ Assigned primary/foreign keys and ensured referential integrity.
- ✅ Used advanced SQL techniques (JOINs, Subqueries, CTEs) to generate insights.
- ✅ Delivered a professional PowerPoint presentation based on the analysis.

---

## 🧱 Database Structure

Simulated tables include:

- `customers`
- `products`
- `orders`
- `regions`
- `sales_channels`

The schema was modeled with real-world sales hierarchies, complete with **1:Many** and **Many:1** relationships. ER diagram available in the presentation file.
